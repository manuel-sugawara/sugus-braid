## Java Syntax

The Java Syntax package defines APIs to generate Java code tailored to
codegen models defined using [Smithy](https://smithy.io/). The API was
inspired by [JavaPoet](https://github.com/square/javapoet) and aims to
feel familiar to users of it,

The API itself is codegen using the same API from a Smithy model.
